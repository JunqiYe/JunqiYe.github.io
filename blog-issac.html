		<p> Google I/O is a Google convention that demostrate the technology innovation for the past year. One of the main subject in this event is Google's artificial intelligence. Right now the development of voice assistance with artificial intelligence is trully amazing. During one of their demo, the Google assistance acctually called a hair salon and helped the user to book a apointment. Usually when we get greeted by machines and the situation is reversed and the AI is helping us to call other people.  </p>

		<p> Tesla is having finance problem again. Starting an innovative tech company is definatly not a easy thing to do, not even for Elon Mask. Many people dont think that company will survive and Elon Musk himself is sleeping in the factury to oversee the development. He also joke about the company going bankrupt during April Fool's day. However, the company definatly have a stong financial support and I really want to see how much the company will achieve. </p>

		<p> According to this article, Plattsburgh is banning bitcoin mining. Honestly I think that bitcoin mining is a terrible thing becuase it is a lost lost situation. Following the recent hype of the bitcoin, bitcoin mining became popular. Everyone thinks that mining is easy and starts to by high performance GPUs which in terms increased the price of all GPUs and it is really bad for the average consumers. Another point is that mining takes a lot of electrical power. Running the GPUs at full intensity is really demanding. Not to mention running a mining rig usually uses more than just one GPUs. In the video, the entire room is full of GPUs... The electrical bill for those rig is crazy. </p>

Some known language for 3GL are C, C++, Pascal and BASIC. Programming in 3GL are favored by using aggregate data types, variable names and the ability to define section of code as subroutines. The program is 3GL is called the Source Program or Source doe and it subsequently convert by a specialized program, the complier.</p>

The instruction in 1GL are made of binary numbers, represented by 1 and 0. The main advantage or programming in 1GL is that the code can run fast and very efficiently because the instructions are processed directly from CPU. </p>

One of the field that directly benefits from more power chip is artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence requires a lot of powerful resources in order to computer the informations. Moore’s law is boosting smartphones industries, and even internet of things. Many modern data centers became very powerful, but it still requires more processing. This process will come from innovations according to Moore’s law.</p>

		<p> Thursday, November 30, 2017: The term for today is Big Data.</p>
		
		<p> Big data is often associated with artificial intelligence because AIs are able to effectively handle and process these informations. Big data basically means the process of traditional data mining and handling that are too large to be process by normal database engines in reasonable time. Big data requires different processing approach due to their size. When the technology becomes more and more advanced, more and more data are being recorded. These data can be harnessed and utilized in algorithms to understand our normal life. For example, through big data, researchers can find the patterns with human movements, relationships between sleeping and health, etc.</p>

		<p> Tuesday, November 28, 2017: The term for today is Internet of Things .</p>
		
		<p> Internet of things(IoT) is defiantly on the test so this is a great change for me to study this. Internet of Things is a concept that every electronics are connected to the internet and through internet, they are able to communicate with each other. Internet of Things brings identity to each devices, including printer, router, etc. Internet of Things is huge because it allows user to break the limit that is surrounding themselves and access remote object and databases. The initial use of Internet of Things is attributed to Kevin Ashton. Internet of Things does not just limit to computer, phones; it extands to just about everything.</p>

		<p> Tuesday, November 21, 2017: The term for today is Artificial intelligence.</p>
		
		<p> This video is very interesting to be because I just finished a research paper on the same topic—artificial intelligence will not destroy Americans jobs. In the video, i saw some similar points in my research paper, but there are also different opinions. Overall, although artificial intelligence might have the ability to replace half of the American job, this will not happen. It is like driving a car that has the ability of driving 300mph, but when you actually driving in it, it will most likely drive around 55mph. Artificial intelligence will also create many benefits to the society including making jobs higher productivity. Therefore, i think society should encourage this technology to make the society better.</p>

		<p> I am actually pretty familiar with IDE. When I program with Java, I used the Java IDE. It usually has a graphical interface that help to program. It really does make every work more fluently and actually. IDE for javascript and python can help programmer with codes appreace. New programs can also benefit greatly from a IDE. All in all, the existence of IDE is to help programmer to maximize their productivity.  </p>

		<p> TESLA just released their new trunk and their new sports car. It is quite amazing.
		They first revealed their semi truck. No-one really thought about creating a electric
		truck simply because it seems impossible. Dragging 80000 pounds of load using electric
		motor is unseen. Not only that, there are no electric motors that was designed for
		this industry. Yet, Tesla's semi truck is outperforming normal semis in every way.
		Tesla also made The truck super aerodynamic. It has less aerodynamic drag comparing
		to other supercars. This simply blows my mind. Their new sport car, on the other hand,
		is more mind blowing. Powered by electric motor, the new sport car, roadster, is able 
		to accelerate from 0 - 60 mph in 1.9 secs, faster than Ferraris, Mclarens, and other
		manufactures. To me, this is pretty crazy.</p>

		Apple charger can only charges iPhone or iPad and usb-c chargers are limited.
		A environment with universal connection is great. Other areas includes security,

		<P> Right now, no-one is really private online. If informations get out there, people

		about their online informations. Many people are taking action around this, including me.
		I am using VPN which is a proxy that encrypt the information sent and received from
