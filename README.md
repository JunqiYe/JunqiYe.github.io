## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JunqiYe/JunqiYe.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JunqiYe/JunqiYe.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Logs

### 3.24
Started researching and intergrating React. 
To use the JSX, use
```markdown
npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod
```
in the same directory. It will auto translate JSX in the src and output to the root folder.

Git comments tips: use imperative for subject line. Use the format "If applied, this commit will ..."
i.e. "If applied, this commit will add ReactJS library and link two old projects".
