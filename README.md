### 3.24
Started researching and intergrating React. 
To use the JSX, use
```markdown
npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod
```
in the same directory. It will auto translate JSX in the src and output to the root folder.

Git comments tips: use imperative for subject line. Use the format "If applied, this commit will ..."
i.e. "If applied, this commit will add ReactJS library and link two old projects".
